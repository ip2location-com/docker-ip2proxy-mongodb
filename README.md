docker-ip2proxy-mongodb
==========================

This is a pre-configured, ready-to-run MongoDB server with IP2Proxy Proxy IP database. It simplifies the development team to install and set up the proxy IP database in MongoDB server. The setup script supports the [commercial database packages](https://www.ip2location.com/database/ip2proxy) and [free LITE package](https://lite.ip2location.com). Please register for a download account before running this image.




## Usage

1. Create a dedicated network so that your application containers can communicate with the IP2Proxy container by name.

    ```bash
    docker network create ip2proxy-network
    ```

2. Run this image as daemon using the download token and product code from [IP2Location LITE](https://lite.ip2location.com) or [IP2Location](https://www.ip2location.com) and attaching it to the network created above.
    ```bash
    docker run --name ip2proxy \
    --network ip2proxy-network \
    -d \
    -e TOKEN={DOWNLOAD_TOKEN} \
    -e CODE={DOWNLOAD_CODE} \
    -e MONGODB_PASSWORD={MONGODB_PASSWORD} \
    ip2proxy/mongodb
    ```

    **ENV Variables**

    `TOKEN` – Download token obtained from IP2Location.
    `CODE` – The CSV file download code. You may get the download code from your account panel.

    `MONGODB_PASSWORD` - Password for MongoDB admin.

3. The installation may take seconds to minutes depending on your database sizes, downloading speed and hardware specs. You may check the installation status by viewing the container logs. Run the below command to check the container log:
    ```bash
    docker logs -f ip2proxy
    ```

    You should see the line `> Setup completed` if you have successfully completed the installation.



## Connect from an Application

Run your application container on the same network. The IP2Proxy container is reachable by its container name (`ip2proxy`) as the hostname:

```bash
docker run --network ip2proxy-network -t -i {YOUR_APPLICATION}
```




## Query for IP Information

1. In your application container, Iinstall MongoDB and Mongo Shell first by following the installation steps in https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-debian/.

2. Run the Mongo Shell with the password you've specified during the installation and connect to `ip2proxy` host.
    ```bash
    mongosh --host ip2proxy -u mongoAdmin -p {MONGODB_PASSWORD} --authenticationDatabase admin
    ```

3. To test the IPv4 database, key in the commands below to query proxy info for IPv4 address `8.8.8.8` (IP number: 134744072).
    ```sql
    use ip2proxy_database
    db.ip2proxy_database.findOne( { $and: [ { ip_from: { $lte: 134744072 } }, { ip_to: { $gte: 134744072 } } ] } )
    ```

4. To test the IPv6 database, key in the commands below to query proxy info for IPv6 address `2001:4860:4860::8888` (IP number: 42541956123769884636017138956568135816).
    ```sql
    use ip2proxy_database
    db.ip2proxy_database.findOne( { $and: [ { ip_from_index: { $lte: "A0042541956123769884636017138956568135816" } }, { ip_to_index: { $gte: "A0042541956123769884636017138956568135816" } } ] } )
    ```

    If you don't know how to convert an IP address to IP number, please see [IP2Location FAQs](https://www.ip2location.com/faqs#technical).

    

    **NOTES**: The search param for IPv4 database is a number BUT the param for IPv6 database is a string of the IP number left-padded with zeroes till 40 characters and prefixed with an "A".
    Also, IPv6 database is filtering on the `ip_from_index` and `ip_to_index` fields while IPv4 database is filtering on the `ip_from` and `ip_to` fields.
    When querying IPv4 address using the IPv6 database, you need to convert the IPv4 address into [IPv4-mapped IPv6 address](https://blog.ip2location.com/knowledge-base/ipv4-mapped-ipv6-address/) before converting to IP number.



## Update IP2Proxy Database

To update your IP2Proxy database to latest version, please run the following  command:

```bash
docker exec -it ip2proxy ./update.sh
```
